A personal internet bookmark application, that users can create lists of their favorite bookmarks to keep track and easily access.

## Motivation

I also bookmark sites, but often forget why and how useful the bookmark actually is. So I would end up never using the bookmarks. I wanted a bookmark app that I could access on any device with a rating and description. Bookmarks and lists are all created by the users.
